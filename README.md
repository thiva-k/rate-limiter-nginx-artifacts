## Description

This repository contains the artifacts, analysis figures, and experimental results from our research on implementing distributed API rate limiting using a load balancer-based approach. The study evaluates multiple rate-limiting algorithms, integration techniques, and state synchronization mechanisms to ensure efficient and scalable API traffic management in distributed environments.
